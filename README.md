# KineticEnzyme

This package provides a comprehensive solution for data analysis
related to the Michaelis Menten model, including linearization of
the data and consideration of the three main cases of enzyme
inhibition. In addition, estimates of great relevance in the
biochemical field are offered, such as the estimated parameters,
the standard errors, and the residual analysis in those cases where
it is necessary.
