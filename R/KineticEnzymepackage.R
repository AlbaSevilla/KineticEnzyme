#' KineticEnzyme Package
#'
#' This package provides a comprehensive solution for data analysis
#' related to the Michaelis Menten model, including linearization of
#' the data and consideration of the three main cases of enzyme
#' inhibition. In addition, estimates of great relevance in the
#' biochemical field are offered, such as the estimated parameters,
#' the standard errors, and the residual analysis in those cases where
#' it is necessary.
#'
#' The package offers various functionalities to handle the data and
#' perform analyses. First, it prepares the data by removing rows that
#' contain zeros. Additionally, if specified, outliers can be removed
#' using Tukey's criterion. The package then proceeds to estimate the
#' model parameters using linear regression and calculates the predicted
#' values by the model.
#'
#' For advanced analysis and diagnostics, the package provides further
#' functionalities. This includes calculating correlations, performing
#' model comparisons using criteria such as ANOVA, AIC, and BIC, and
#' analyzing the residuals for normality, homoscedasticity, and
#' autocorrelation. Furthermore, the package enables the calculation of
#' confidence intervals for the estimated parameters and allows for
#' visually interpreting the results by plotting the data along with
#' corresponding confidence bands.
#'
#' In summary, the KineticEnzyme package offers a complete and cohesive
#' tool for analyzing data related to the Michaelis Menten model. It
#' provides a wide range of functionalities, facilitates interpretation,
#' and aids in decision making in the biochemical field.
